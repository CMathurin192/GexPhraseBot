# GexPhraseBot
A Twitter bot made to mimic the phrasal tendencies of the fictional character, Gex the Gecko.

Made in 2020 and worked on and maintained for two years, GexPhraseBot is a Twitter bot that amassed 3000 followers during its run, now dormant due to the API change of Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter). It had features such as randomly generating Tweets, replying to specific users' Tweets for engagement, keeping track of its followers, and changing its profile picture depending on the occasion.
